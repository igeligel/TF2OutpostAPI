## Login 
You need to grab the cookies after you did the steam login.
I suggest u to use Jessecar96's Steambot: https://github.com/Jessecar96/SteamBot.
Then pass the data to the constructor.

## Get Cookies after the login
After you did the login you can get the hash as a string directly (only authentification) or as CookieContainer.

## Get Data from api/core/ of tf2outpost after you login successfully.
There are some parameters which can be important later.
